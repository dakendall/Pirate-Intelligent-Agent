# Pirate-Intelligent-Agent

For this project, we created a treasure hunt game. The player needs to find the treasure before the pirates. I was tasked with designing an intelligent agent as a pirate non-player character. I was given some starter code and a sample environment. I created a deep Q-learning algorithm to train the pirate. The pirate begins with no knowledge of the game. They will need to navigate the game world that contains different pathways and obstacles.
Computer scientist design, develop, and analyze software and hardware that are used to solve problems. I approach a problem by first identifying what is the problem. Then I create a plan on how to solve the problem and then excute the plan. It is a good idea to keep the end user in mind when solving these problems.  When it comes to developing software, we can run into different ethical issues such as biases and how user's data is used. Their benefits and security should be a top priority. I represent the orginzation I work for and it is my responsibility to uphold their values. If I have ethical concerns, I would speak with the proper management to address the issue.
